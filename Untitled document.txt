GRAPHS


* A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.
* Vertex − Each node of the graph is represented as a vertex.
* Edge − Edge represents a path between two vertices.
* Adjacency − Two node or vertices are adjacent if they are connected to each other through an edge.
* Path − Path represents a sequence of edges between the two vertices.


Types of graphs 
* DIRECTED
* UNDIRECTED


GRAPH TRAVERSAL TECHNIQUES
* BFS
* DFS


BFS (BREADTH FIRST SEARCH)


We use the following steps to implement BFS traversal...
* Step 1 - Define a Queue of size total number of vertices in the graph.
* Step 2 - Select any vertex as starting point for traversal. Visit that vertex and insert it into the Queue.
* Step 3 - Visit all the non-visited adjacent vertices of the vertex which is at front of the Queue and insert them into the Queue.
* Step 4 - When there is no new vertex to be visited from the vertex which is at front of the Queue then delete that vertex.
* Step 5 - Repeat steps 3 and 4 until queue becomes empty.
* Step 6 - When queue becomes empty, then produce final spanning tree by removing unused edges from the graph
